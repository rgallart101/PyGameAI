# Python and Pygame

Code for the example in chapter 7 from the ["Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame"](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Game-Development-Python-Pygame/dp/1590598725).

It has been developed on a Debian 7 creating a virtual environment with Python 2.7.3. All the libraries needed are in requirements.txt.

## How to run it

Activate the virtual environment and run

```
python chap7.py
```

Have fun looking at the ants :)
